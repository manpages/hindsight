## Jonn Hindsights

A lot of time has passed since I have been writing coherent texts for
audience broader than my colleagues and employees. It\'s time for my
blog to resurface on the net in another attempt of mine to regularly
publish texts.

Since I've last wrote public posts I've picked up reading again,
being rather serious about it, so expect a fair share of book reviews
(I read over twenty five books in the first three and a half months of
2018).

On the other hand, I'm almost not programming at all, so expect
little to none rants about how terrible computers are (even though
I'm rather frustrated with the experience of self-hosting a blog
again).

These days I'm running a company with my best friend and business
partner -- Arseniy Seroka, so expect some posts on herding cats.

And you can always reach out to me with suggestions about desired
content, E-Mail is _jm at this domain_.
